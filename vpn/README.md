# Terraform Module: VPN

Launches an isolated Outline VPN instance with it's own VPC.



## Usage

```terraform
module "outline-vpn" {
  source = "github.com/dbl-works/terraform//vpn?ref=v2021.08.24"

  account_id  = 12345678
  eip         = "0.0.0.0"
  ami_id      = "ami-07e4ed4c95c385519"
  project     = "dbl"
  environment = "production"
  cidr_block  = "10.0.0.0/16"
  key_name    = "outline-server-ssh"

  # optional
  region        = "eu-central-1"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}
```



## Initial Outline configuration after first launch

:warning: Perform this initial setup only once during set up.

We cannot currently run ssh commands using Terraform, so we need to manually configure Outline after it's online. The easiest way to do this is to

- SSH into the EC2: `ssh -i "outline-server-ssh.pem" ubuntu@$AWS_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP`
- grab the initial config: `sudo cat /opt/outline/access.txt` (which still contains the wrong HOST)
- Copy the config to your local editor, then update the HOST to be your EIP
- Paste the config in the following format into outline manager:

```json
{
  "apiUrl": "https://127.0.0.1:1234/xxx",
  "certSha256": "xxx"
}
```

The next step is to configure the hostname/IP that will be used for generating access keys. By default, this will be the one created inside the packer AMI. Using the same `apiUrl` as above, run the following command:

```shell
export AWS_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP=123.123.123.123 # aws_instance.main.public_ip
export API_URL=https://$AWS_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP:1234/xxx
# NOTE: you MUST replace the "PASTE_AWS_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP_HERE" before running the command
#       because in bash, anything inside single quotes is preserved literally and not expanded
#       You could also set an A-Record (e.g. in Cloudflare) to have a URL like "https://proxy.dbl.works/" instead of an IP
curl --insecure -X PUT -d '{"hostname":"PASTE_AWS_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP_HERE"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" $API_URL/server/hostname-for-access-keys
```

To verify everything is setup correctly, you can view the current server status:

```shell
curl --insecure $API_URL/server
```

Find the full documentation of Outline's API [here](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server/master/src/shadowbox/server/api.yml)



## Get access credentials for Outline Manager

```shell
ssh -i outline-server-ssh.pem ubuntu@$AWS_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP

# on the server
sudo cat /opt/outline/access.txt
```

copy paste the output into Outline Manager (formatted as JSON).

Potentially, we can get this in Terraform, find a draft in the experimental PR [#33](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/33).



## Create EIP

You need to create the EIP manually in the account first, then hard code in the value for the module config.

## Create SSH Key

You need to create a keypair in EC2 manually and have access to this locally (we store these in 1Password).

## Custom Domain

By default the VPN will launch with just the public IP address (EIP). If you want to access this via a friendly name (e.g. proxy.dbl.works) then you should add a DNS entry (A record) with the EIP as the value for the subdomain you want.

`A proxy.dbl.works. 127.0.0.1`
