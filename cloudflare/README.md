# Terraform Module: Cloudflare

This module will do the following:

- Route to defaults routes
    - api.my-project.com to the NLB
    - bastion.my-project.com
    - cdn.my-project.com to the S3-Bucket (using Cloudflare Workers)
    - xx.my-project.com to the S3-Bucket (using Cloudflare Workers) for any subdomain needed

## Pre-setup
1. Setup the domain in Cloudflare
2. Setup and publish your CDN cloudflare worker.

3. Make sure you have created an API token in your Cloudflare account with sufficient permissions
- You can have a look at the cloudflare permissions [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens/create/permissions/)
- You should have access to
  - All zones - Zone:Edit, Workers Routes:Edit, DNS:Edit


```shell
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=xxx
```
