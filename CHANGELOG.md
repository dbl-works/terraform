# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) ~~and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0)~~.

This project does not follow SemVer, since modules are independent of each other; thus, SemVer does not make sense. Changes are grouped per module.

## [unreleased]
### RDS
- consistenly use `local.name` instead of `project-environment`. By default, both are the same, but `local.name` can be overridden to allow for more flexibility; e.g. when one needs to launch multiple RDS instances for the same project/environment.

## [v2022.12.12]
## Autoscaling/ECS
- added new module to configure auto-scaling for ECS [#136](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/136), [#140](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/140), [#142](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/142), [#143](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/143)

## ECS
- allow creating a cluster without passing secret/KMS key ARN(s) [#146](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/146)
- Enable that we can (dis)allow listing all ECS Clusters or S3 Buckets [#149](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/149)
- Adds missing permissions to retrieve object versions from S3 [#150](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/150)

## Multiple Modules
- Internal refactoring, better outputs, etc [#139](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/139), [#148](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/148)

## IAM
- adds IAM role/group to grant access to view X-Ray [#138](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/138)

## Snowflake
- Fixed Inconsistent Return Type for Cloudwatch/Snowflake Output [#132](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/132)
- Adds SQL Script For A Readonly User/Role [#135](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/135)
- fivetran/connectors/lambda: Improve and extract lambda module [#137](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/137), [#145](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/145)

## RDS
- Add DB instructions to connect DB to Fivetran, [#125](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/125)

## [v2022.09.30]
## Elasticache
- set `cluster_mode`, `maxmemory_policy`, `elasticache_node_count`, `elasticache_automatic_failover_enabled` as variables instead of hardcore values.

## Analytics, Cloudwatch-Snowflake, Fivetran, Snowflake/Cloud
- added new modules to launch a **Snowflake Warehouse**, and connect various data sources to the warehouse using **Fivetran**. The "Analytics" module brings all these sub modules together and introduces default values. Submodules can also be combined in any way if more flexibility is needed. These modules have been tested and are operational, though there are still some rough edges (see for example [Issue #127](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/issues/127)).

## RDS
- set replacement of non-alphanumeric chars with underscore on RDS DBName value to avoid naming validation errors.

## [v2022.09.07]
## Elasticache
- added `maxmemory_policy` as the optional options. Default value is `volatile-lru`

## Slack
- added a new module to launch Chatbot and SNS topic required for Slack message, [#116](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/116)

## Cloudwatch
- added a new module to launch cloudwatch module [#116](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/116)

## RDS
- add option to enable DB replication with new parameter `enable_replication` [#119](https://github.com/dbl-works/terraform/pull/119)
- if `enable_replication` is changed on a running DB, the DB will need to be restarted manually

## [v2022.08.05]
## Elasticache
- `multi_az_enabled` can now optionally be turned off

## Secrets
- Improved documentation
- allow `description` to be optional

## Stack
- pass `multi_az_enabled` through to Elasticache
- fix `allow_from_security_groups` to have a predictable length for terraform
