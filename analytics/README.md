# Analytics

This combines multiple modules, namely:

* [Snowflake](../snowflake/cloud/README.md)
* [Fivetran](../fivetran/README.md)
* [AWS Secrets](../secrets/README.md)
* Tableau: as of now, the terraform provider is limited to creating users, but we want to auto provision via Google Workspace, so that is pointless for us. See the [docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/GtheSheep/tableau/latest/docs/resources/group)

## Usage

Copy paste the `secrets.json` file into your terraform script folder and **gitignore** it.
Then add all credentials that you want to have pre-populated. Later, you will have to edit secrets directly in the AWS Secrets Vault.


```terraform
module "awesome-module" {
  source = "github.com/dbl-works/terraform//analytics?ref=v2021.07.05"

  # Required
  environment = "staging"
  project     = "someproject"
}
```

## Concepts


The following Mermaid graph visualized the concept of why we need this module:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Business-Data
    direction LR
    A1("AWS Cloudtrail")
    A2("Sentry")
    A3("Application DBs (AWS)")
    end
    subgraph Technical-Data
    direction LR
    B1("Google Analytics")
    B2("Notion")
    B3("Application DBs (AWS)")
    end
    Business-Data --> C
    Technical-Data --> C
    C("ETL (Fivetran)") --> D
    D("Data Warehouse (Snowflake Cloud)") --> E
    E("BI Tool (Tableau Cloud)") --> F1
    E("BI Tool (Tableau Cloud)") --> F2
    F1("Advanced Queries")
    F2("Simple KPI Dashboards")
```


Fivetran needs access to the Snowflake Data Warehouse.
Snowflake should disallow any access and maintain an explicit alowlist.
